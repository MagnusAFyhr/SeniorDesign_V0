## What Does It Do?
- Hypothesis
```
Due to the difficulty in short-term forecasting of stock price based on technical indicators, it is increasingly 
difficult to associate specific or groups of technical indicator signals to the fluctuating price of a stock; 
furthermore, considering that the signal and relationship between these signals can change overtime then it is 
exponentially more difficult to forecast short-term performance of any given stock. Therefore, due to the adaptive 
nature of evolutionary algorithms over time, an approach using a tailored genetic algorithm to this paradigm will be 
effective at determining: valuable technical signals, constructive groupings of these signals, intelligent weighting 
of signals within groups and threshold values for grouped signals. Ultimately, resulting in a genetically programmed 
trading bot that predicts the price movement of a given stock to provide returns that result in a consistent positive 
monthly ROI.
