## Introduction
- Theory
```
Due to the difficulty in short-term forecasting of stock price based on technical indicators,
it is increasingly difficult to associate specific, or groups of, technical indicator signals 
to the fluctuating price of a stock; furthermore, considering that the signal, and relationship 
between these signals, can change overtime then it is exponentially more difficult to forecast 
short-term performance of any given stock. Therefore, due to the adaptive nature of evolutionary 
algorithms over time, an approach using a tailored genetic algorithm to this paradigm will be 
effective at determining: valuable technical signals, constructive groupings of these signals,
intelligent weighting of signals within groups and threshold values for grouped signals. 
Ultimately, resulting in a genetically programmed trading bot that predicts the price movement 
of a given stock to provide returns that result in a consistent positive monthly ROI.
