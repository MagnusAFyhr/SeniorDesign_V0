## What Is This Project?
- Hypothesis
```
Due to the difficulty in short-term forecasting of stock price based on technical indicators, it is increasingly 
difficult to associate specific, or groups of, technical indicator signals to the fluctuating price of a stock; 
furthermore, considering that the signal, and relationship between these signals, can change overtime then it is 
exponentially more difficult to forecast short-term performance of any given stock. Therefore, due to the adaptive 
nature of evolutionary algorithms over time, an approach using a tailored genetic algorithm to this paradigm will be 
effective at determining: valuable technical signals, constructive groupings of these signals, intelligent weighting 
of signals within groups and threshold values for grouped signals. Ultimately, resulting in a genetically programmed 
trading bot that predicts the price movement of a given stock to provide returns that result in a consistent positive 
monthly ROI.

- Background
```
Stock market prediction is a notorious paradigm with no definite formula for success. An evolutionary approach will
attempt to discern which technical indicators are most important by succumbing as many bots as computationally 
optimal to Darwinistic evolution. Furthermore, over many generations ‘good’ trading behavior would be rewarded in 
increasing the likeliness a bot survives and reproduces its genes; however, poor behavior would be punished by 
reducing the likeliness genetic reproduction and possibly extinction. This algorithm will incorporate unsupervised 
learning; meaning there will be no control over what the bots determine as better or worse genetics; but 
hypothetically, over many generations, the population should move towards more successful strategies with higher 
returns on investment; due to the nature of fitness based evolution. Using historical data, our program will simulate 
the daily price movements of a given stock in steps and over some generational period, recycle and rebuild a 
population to be simulated again. The aim of the project is to evolve a population of bots over many generations, 
over a wide range of stocks, and at termination contain a best bot that consistently provides a positive 
monthly ROI over a defined sample size.
